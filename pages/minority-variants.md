<p><strong>Exploring the role of minority variants in RSV transmission and evolution</strong>
<p><strong> Study PI: </strong><a href="{{ site.url }}/george-githinji"> George Githinji (PhD)</a></p>

<p class="text-justify">
Whole genome consensus sequence data provides information that represents the dominant virus subtype. 
It does not provide sufficient information for resolving transmission events particularly for rapidly spreading viruses.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
This project aims to explore whether changes in the composition of minor variants between hosts and the pattern of minor 
variants fixation during outbreaks, could provide additional data to resolve transmission patterns.
