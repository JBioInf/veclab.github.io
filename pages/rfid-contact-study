<p><strong>Understanding social contact networks and the spread of respiratory infections</strong></p>
<p><strong>Study PI:</strong> Moses Kiti</p>

<p class="text-justify"> 
Common respiratory infections such as flu spread when we come into contact with germs emitted by sick individuals through coughing or sneezing. Our social interactions generate networks that can be defined by how many people we meet in a day or how much time we spend with them in different locations. These time-varying networks influence how these infections may spread. We are using electronic sensors to determine network patterns at schools and households in rural and urban areas of Kilifi.
Understanding social networks leads to better insights into how infections can spread in a community, and may assist to determine influential groups of people that can be targeted for intervention measures.
