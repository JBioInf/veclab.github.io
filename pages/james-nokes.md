<h6>Prof James Nokes</h6>
<p class="text-justify">

James trained in Zoology followed by a PhD in viral epidemiology, out of which developed an enduring interest in the transmission dynamics and control
of human viral pathogens. A post-doc period at Imperial College was followed by two years at Oxford and then Warwick from 1995, which remains his home institution where he is a Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology.

<p class="text-justify">
His research initially centred on
vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and HBV and involved collaborative studies in Ethiopia. In 2001, James' interests shifted to the study of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accompanying a move of scientific base to the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research
Programme (KWTRP) in Kilifi, Kenya.</p>

<p class="text-justify">
This fascinating, antigenically diverse virus - a major cause of childhood pneumonia - remains a focus of his research up to today. Currently, he works within the Epidemiology and Demography Department, with research support
primarily from a Wellcome Trust Senior Investigator Award.
