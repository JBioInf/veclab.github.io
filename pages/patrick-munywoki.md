<h6>Patrick Munywoki (BSc,MSc,PhD)</h6>
<p class="text-justify">
I am a post-doctoral research scientist at <a href="http://www.kemri-wellcome.org" target="blank">KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme (KWTRP)</a>, in Kilifi, Kenya. I joined the programme as a project assistant in November 2005 after completion of a BSc (Nursing Sciences) Degree in Moi University. My main roles were to support inpatient surveillance of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Since then I has been involved in a broad range of research activities, including the development of new research protocols and expansion of the inpatient surveillance to include other respiratory pathogens.

<p class="text-justify">
 In 2008, I was awarded a Commonwealth MSc training scholarship, and completed the MSc in Public Health in Developing Countries at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, United Kingdom in October 2009, passing with a distinction. Upon my return, I initiated epidemiological studies to investigate the transmission patterns of a range of respiratory viruses in the community settings. 
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
These studies formed part of my Ph.D training under the supervision of Professors D. James Nokes (affiliated to KWTRP, Kilifi, Kenya and University of Warwick, UK) and Graham F. Medley (University of Warwick, UK). I  successfully defended my  thesis 'Transmission of Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Households: Who Acquires Infection from Whom' at the Open University, UK in August 2013.

I am  currently interested in unravelling <a href="{{ site.url }}/spred-kenya" >transmission dynamics of a range
of respiratory viruses</a>
in Kenya and identify potential control strategies.
