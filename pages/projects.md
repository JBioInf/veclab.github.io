        <p><strong>Studying the Pathways of Respiratory Virus Diseases (SPReD)</strong></p>
    
        <p class="text-justify">
        SPReD aims to advance understanding of the nature of spread of respiratory viruses (RSV, influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus) at 
                different scales of observation from the individual, household and school, local community to countrywide, 
                and use this information to innovate interventions.  The work represents an integration of epidemiological, 
                virus sequence, contact and mobility data.

  <p><strong>Rotavirus Immunization Program Evaluation Kenya (RIPEK)</strong></p>
  <p class="text-justify">
  A comprehensive countrywide evaluation of the introduction of rotavirus vaccination in Kenya. This is collaborative with CDC-Kenya, WRP-Kenya,
  Kenya MoH, and CDC and Emory Atlanta, USA.  Central is a before-after evaluation of impact on disease incidence which will also assess 
  replacement and origins of genotypes and variants using partial and whole genome sequencing.

  Projections of the population-level impact of vaccination against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) using transmission dynamic models. 
  This a GSK contracted study to inform vaccine design and implementation and is collaborative with MAEMOD at the Mahidol-Oxford Research

  <p><strong>Infection Dynamics in a Demographic Transition</strong></p>
  <p class="text-justify">
  The impact of Demographic Changes on Infectious DisEases transmission and control in middle/low income countries (DECIDE). 
  The demographic transition has implications to infectious disease epidemiology and intervention design. With Bocconi University 
  we are quantifying urban-rural social mixing in coastal Kenya which will support Individual Based Modelling (IBM) of infection transmission.

  <p><strong>Quantifying RSV Protective Immunity Correlates</strong></p>
  
  <p class="text-justify">
  PATH favour the maternal vaccine approach to boost infant passive immunity and delay the first, most severe, infection. 
  To support this we are undertaking serological studies of RSV passive antibody dynamics, evaluating alternative assays 
  to PRNT and identify the protective efficacy of passive immunity in a cohort and case control study.
