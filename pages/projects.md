<p><strong><a> The RSV household study </a></strong></p>
This study examines the utility of RSV whole genome sequencing (WGS) in understanding better RSV transmission and evolution within households and in the community. The primary data arise from a household cohort study we conducted in a rural coastal community of Kenya between November 2009 and June 2010 to illuminate on Who Acquires Infection From Whom (WAIFW) within households.

<p><strong><a>The RSV immunology study</a></strong></p>
This study uses systems immunology approaches to identify biomarkers of severe Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection in infancy. We use a wide range of systems tools ranging from transcriptomics, mass cytometry, metabolomics and studies of the respiratory microbiome to identify host factors that are uniquely expressed in severe disease.
