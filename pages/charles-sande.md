I am a Wellcome Trust research fellow at KEMRI-Wellcome Trust research programme and the University of Oxford.

<p class="text-justify">
My main research interests are in the development and validation of prognostic biomarkers for acute respiratory infections in infants. I am also involved in early preclinical development of virus vectored vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and have previously worked in the clinical evaluation of first-in-man vaccine studies of RSV in early phase I trials. Prior to that I undertook studies on the development of protective immunity to RSV infants.
