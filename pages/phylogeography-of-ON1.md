A new variant of RSV was first identified in 2010 in Ontario Canada, named ON1, and subsequently spread globally, including Kenya. The project aims to track this variant within Kenya, and this has the potential to greatly improve understanding of the origins and fate of introduced RSV strains, their patterns of spread (temporally and spatially), and how this relates to evolution of the virus.
