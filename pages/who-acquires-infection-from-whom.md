<p><strong>Integrating viral RNA sequence data and epidemiological data to define transmission patterns for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)</strong>

 <p class="text-justify"> 
In order to control diseases, we first need to increase our understanding of transmission. This can be aided by analyzing as much data as possible within a single framework. This project aims to integrate different data types in a single mathematical model in order to infer the transmission chain.
