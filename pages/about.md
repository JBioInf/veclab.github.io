The Virus Epidemiology and Control Research Group is based at the <a href="http://www.kemri-wellcome.org" target="blank">KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme</a> in Kenya. 
Our group investigates the transmission dynamics of virus pathogens, particularly respiratory and enteric viruses to increase basic 
understanding and to inform control strategies.

<p class="text-justify" class="lead">
Our research work applies a wide range of multidisciplinary approaches that involve molecular, 
immunological, bioinformatics, mathematical modelling, electronic tagging and social tools.
