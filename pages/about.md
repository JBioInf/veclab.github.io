The Virus Epidemiology and Control Research Group, based at the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme in Kenya, 
investigates the transmission dynamics of virus pathogens, particularly respiratory and enteric viruses. Our aim is to increase basic 
understanding and to inform control strategies. Our research work applies a wide range of multidisciplinary approaches that involve molecular, 
immunological, bioinformatics, mathematical modelling, electronic tagging and social tools.
