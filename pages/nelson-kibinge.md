<p class="text-justify">
Although originally a biologist, I have skills and experience in bioinformatics particularly in development of tools for sequence analysis applications for phylogenetics and transcriptomics. My current research project focuses on designing sampling strategies for optimizing diversity capture based on RSV sequences. Other projects include spatial epidemiology work whose objective is to map transmission patterns RSV in Kenya.
