<h6>Charles Agoti (BSc,MSc,PhD)</h6>

<p class="text-justify">
I am a post-doc in the Viral Epidemiology and Control Group interested in the molecular epidemiology of viral infectious diseases in Kenya and beyond. Primarily, I apply phylogenetics and other bioinformatics tools to understand epidemic composition, transmission and evolution from sequence data. My work has provided initial important insights on the origins, patterns of introduction, transmission, reinfection and persistence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) strains that cause annual epidemics in the local Kenyan populations.

<p class="text-justify">
I earned my first degree from Nairobi University (Biochemistry), followed with a Masters degree in Molecular Biology of Infectious Diseases from London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a PhD in Viral Molecular Epidemiology from The Open University.

In 2008 I was awarded a Wellcome Trust Masters Fellowship for a period of  30 months. Currently I am also an adjunct Lecturer at Pwani University, Kenya and I have co-authored 12 published papers in various peer-reviewed journals.
