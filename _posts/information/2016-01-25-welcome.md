Welcome to our new website and retrospect new blog!
Software development can be a complex process and therefore several software development approaches, philosophies and principles have emerged. Many organisations ascribe to one or more of these approaches depending on the size of the development team and the nature of the problem or task. The Agile and the Unix philosophies have come to be widely adopted in most organisations and also by individual developers.

The Unix philosophy advocates for programs that do one thing very well. Programs that work together and provide universal interfaces and in particular to text streams. The idea stems from years of experience developing the Unix tools. The Unix philosophy it is not a written manifesto that you have to ascribe to or sign, it is a respected tradition that organically grew from writing the early Unix operating system and associated tools.
